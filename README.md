The objective of this project is to use a series of Machine Learning Methods as a powerful approach for solving the problem of policy evaluation
of the conditional money transfer policy Avancemos in Costa Rica, studied for the years 2010 to 2021, and using as a base the observational data National Household Survey for these years. The variable of interest, from which the impact of the policy will be studied is child labor, while also controlling for the endogeneity of the program participation, and the preservation of the a great amount of variables. For the estimation of the treatment effect, the Double Debiased Machine Learning Method is used, with Lasso, Adaboost, Random Forest and Tree Models. The effect of the program is mildly positive with a positive effect of around 1% to 4% of moving reducing the possibility of a child 12-17 years old, to choose working over school.
